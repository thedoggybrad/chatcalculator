## A short history
✓The journey of ChatCalculator started when I developed DogGPT which is a fork of CatGPT.<br> ✓After some time, using ChatGPT I made a fork of my own DogGPT to become ChatMath.<br> 
✓The name "ChatMath" is now not visible to you anymore because it is now "ChatCalculator".<br> 
✓This can only handle the Negative and Postiive Values at first without the support for decimals.<br>
✓Later on, support for decimals was added due to ChatGPT's help.<br>
✓A couple of months later, support for exponential equations was added due to ChatGPT's help.
